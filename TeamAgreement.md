I have found that it is best if everyone works together from the beginning and keeps pace throughout the project. Stand-ups each morning should set the tone and pace for the day with clear goals and tasks to complete for the day.

*NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.*
