# Prepare for Projects: Systems Selection Document

## Scenario and Requirements

### Client is

*A small CGI company was founded by two high-school friends who started out making videos on their phones. Now they employ a few more artists and a business manager. The two founders live together and their home has served as a defacto office, but the other employees usually work from home.*

* With the money from recent advertising jobs, they want to hire more artists and move into a real office where they will have the space to
  expand.

* They want to move away from the BYOD method and start providing computers owned and managed by the company.

* The artists are proficient and responsible Windows and Mac users, but lack any IT skills.

* Artists work mostly on powerful Mac or Windows workstations, though they also have laptops used for lighter work
  and when filming.

* Managing the many large video and graphics files has been a pain-point. With artists working from home, the
  stop-gap solution has been a poorly organized shelf of external and internal hard-drives used to move data to and
  from the founders' home.

* They would like some kind of central data storage solution on site at their office.

* They may want to make this central data storage solution accessible remotely in the future, but that is not a current need.

## Systems Selection

Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you’ll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.

Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’re going to implement for your client. For each, explain:

<br>

### **How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?**

### **What problem or pain point does it solve?**

* *In other words, what value does this add to your client?*
* *Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.*

### **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.**

* *What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?*

<br>

*During your pitch, your instructor will help you scope your project.*

*Some features may become MVP and some may become stretch goals.*

*Once you are ready, find your instructor and pitch your solution ideas.*

*Scope creep can be dangerous! Keeping your project within a predetermined scope will help the group stay on task without going off on tangents and side features.*
