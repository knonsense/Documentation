## Systems Selection

*Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you’ll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.*

*Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’re going to implement for your client. For each, explain:*

***How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?***

*

***What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?***

*

***Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.***

*

***Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.***

*

*What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
During your pitch, your instructor will help you scope your project.*

*Some features may become MVP and some may become stretch goals.*

*Once you are ready, find your instructor and pitch your solution ideas.*

*Scope creep can be dangerous! Keeping your project within a predetermined scope will help the group stay on task without going off on tangents and side features.*
